# Project Background

TransactIQ, a leading Nigerian fintech company, rolled out a major upgrade to its mobile and web applications on January 1, 2025, featuring a **redesigned user interface, new transaction flows, and backend infrastructure enhancements**. The upgrade was part of a broader strategy to improve user experience, reduce transaction failures, and strengthen customer trust.

Three months into the rollout, TransactIQ initiated a data-driven evaluation to **assess the performance of the new system and early feedback indicated a mix of improvements and challenges**, prompting leadership to commission a comprehensive analysis. The primary goal of this project was to find out users' friction points.

This project empowers TransactIQâ€™s teams to **track the actual impact of the app redesign**, identify opportunities for backend and frontend optimization, and quantify progress in key areas such as system reliability, and transaction throughput.

* **Device Channel Usage vs Failure Rate**: Compares transaction reliability across devices (POS, mobile, USSD).

* **Customer Segmentation by Drop-Offs**
